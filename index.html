    <h2>Hello.</h2>
       <p>
           Prior to staying home to raise my three daughters (10yrs, 7yrs, and 7mos), I spent more than 10 years as
        a structural biologist and biochemist. During this time, I gained significant experience working with
        large and complex data sets (e.g. protein x-ray crystallography). I have since developed a knack for computer
        programming.

      <h3>Computer Programming</h3>
      <p class="code-skill-description">I have long been interested in learning to code. While being a SAHD is time-consuming, I have found time to
          teach myself how to code during my kids' nap time and during the evenings. Throughout my time as a SAHD, I
          have become competent in Python, HTML, and CSS.</p>

      <h3>Lego building</h3>
      <p class="lego-skill-description">I have played with Legos since I was little and have continued to enjoy building into adulthood.
          I have been fortunate to be able to share this passion and hobby with my children. We very much enjoy building
          and playing with Legos in our free time and I hope that one day my kids will share this experience with their own.</p>
